# Little Man Virtual Machine

> Did you mean: [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)? ðŸ™„

**A compiler + virtual machine to execute LMC assembly on your computer.**

**NOTE: this README references extended modes. This feature is not yet implemented. It is documented to serve as a reference for future work.**

### Extended instruction set

These instructions are unique to this implementation of the LMC.

You can enable them by starting the file with `; lmvm-ext <version>`. The latest extended mode version is 1.

| Code | Mnemonic | Description                     |
|------|----------|---------------------------------|
| 903  | `ERR`    | Output to stderr                |
| 904  | `TXT`    | Toggle string input/output mode |
| 01x  | `SLP`    | Sleep for x milliseconds        |
|      | `CST`    | Constant declaration            |
|      | `IMP`    | Import file                     |

The `ERR` instruction acts just like `OUT`, except it outputs to stderr instead of stdout.

The `TXT` instruction toggles the string input/output mode. When enabled, the `INP` instruction will read the next character from stdin or #0 if the end of input is reached. The `OUT` instruction will push a char to the buffer, which will be displayed when #0 is outputted.

The `SLP` instruction will sleep for x milliseconds. To attain a longer delay, call it multiple times.

The `CST` pseudo-instruction is used to declare constants. It functions the same as `DAT`, except the value may not be changed.

The `IMP` pseudo-instruction imports another file, where the relative or absolute path to it is named in place of the operand. This is accomplished by simply inserting the contents of the file on the line where this instruction is found, except any `DAT` declarations, which are inserted at the bottom to keep the program valid.

> **Warning** There are no safeguards against circular imports. If you import a file that imports the current file, you will get an infinite loop. Additionally, no spaces are allowed in the file path.

## Addressing modes

| Symbol | Description                        | Example       | Definition of mode                                                                       |
|--------|------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (none) | Direct                             | `ADD 5`       | Use the operand as an address to the value                                               |
| LABEL  | Direct (described by DAT at LABEL) | `ADD fivevar` | Use the operand as a label for the address to the value (as declared in a DAT statement) |

> **Warning** The available memory addresses are 00-99 only. Any address outside of this range will cause an error.

> **Note** In a DAT statement, the operand is an immediate value. It will only fail if the operand is a label. It is the initial value of the variable.

### Extended addressing modes

These addressing modes are unique to this implementation of the LMC.

You can enable them by starting the file with `; lmvm-ext <version>`. The latest extended mode version is 1.

| Symbol | Description | Example  | Definition of mode                                                                   |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~      | Absolute    | `ADD ~5` | Use the operand as an absolute address of the parent computer's memory to the value. |
| &      | Indirect    | `ADD &5` | Use the operand as an address to an address to the value                             |
| #      | Immediate   | `ADD #5` | Use the operand as the value                                                         |

> **Warning** For absolute addressing, expect SEGFAULTS and values too big for the LMC! Additionally, you are limited to addresses 00-99 of the parent computer's memory as with the LMC. There are no real uses for this addressing mode (unless you have some memory-mapped peripherals that are somehow using memory between 00 and 99 ðŸ¤”), but it's there if you need it.

> **Note** In a DAT statement, the operand will always be an immediate value, no matter how it is written (
> e.g. `var DAT 5` and `var DAT #5` are the same expression). It will only fail if the operand is a label. It is the initial value of the variable.

## Using labels

Labels can be used as branching points, or as a name for a memory space when used with the DAT operation.

## Execution arguments

### Assembler

The first positional argument is the input file to use as the entrypoint. It is **required**.<br />
Additionally, these arguments are available:

| Short arg  | Long arg         | Description                                                                                                       |
|------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -o \<file> | --output \<file> | Output file, defaults to the same file name as the input (but with executable extension) in the current directory |
| -h         | --help           | Display help                                                                                                      |
| -k         | --no-overwrite   | Keep the output file if it already exists. Refuses to overwrite.                                                  |
| -v         | --version        | Display version                                                                                                   |
| -D         | --debug          | Enable debug mode                                                                                                 |
| -S         | --strict         | Strict mode. Treat warnings as errors.                                                                            |

### Virtual machine

The first positional argument is the file to execute. It is **required**.<br />
Additionally, these arguments are available:

| Short arg  | Long arg           | Description               |
|------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| -l \<file> | --log-file \<file> | Log file                  |
| -h         | --help             | Display help              |
| -v         | --version          | Display version           |
| -D         | --debug            | Enable debug mode         |

## Example programs

### [Count to 5](examples/count_to_5.lmasm)

```asm
; Count to 5

loop    LDA count  ; load the value of count into the accumulator
        ADD one
        OUT        ; output the value of the accumulator
        STA count  ; hold the value of the accumulator into count
        SUB five   ; subtract 5 from the accumulator...
        BRZ end    ; ...to therefore stop execution if the count is 5 (ACC=0)
        BRA loop   ; else, branch to loop
end     HLT
        
        
count   DAT 0
one     DAT 1
five    DAT 5
```
